# Port-redux

This file for this portfolio website does not yet currently have mobile responsiveness and has limited animations styled.
I am currently working on code issues for desktop to ensure the files display correctly.

Analytical information to current file progress.

the hero section is to contain a singular animated blob svg overlayed with a photo of me. with another overlay of text detailing "Front end", "&" and "digital design" staged from left to right. Using Javascript and css to move and fade out "Front end" to the left based on scroll and vice versa for "digital design" while "&" simply fades out.

The blob and blob animation can be attributed to blobanimation.com

complimentary fade-in animation feature for general introduction.

staggered fade-in from right, for introduction skillsets.

Staggered load-in via lazy loading for graphical skill set display along with ai generated images that are edited and recolored in Canva editor. Using the midjourney.ai art generator, editing required alternating graphic backgrounds, coloring, and text.
Also contains a on hover scale img to 1.5x the size animated at 0.3 seconds.

Contact section styled in a minimalist fashion. A long term plan to comeback to this feature so that emails and messages information are logged into a excel spread sheet using either JavaScript or Python(depending on skill and resources).
